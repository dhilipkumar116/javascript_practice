        Throttling is used to call a function after 
        every millisecond or a particular interval of time only 
        the first click is executed immediately.

        Debouncing:- It is used to invoke/call/execute function only when things have 
        stopped happening for a given specific time. For example, Call a search 
        function to fetch the result when the user has stopped typing in the search box. 
        If the user keeps on typing then reset the function.

        Throttling:- It is used to restrict the no of time a function can be 
        called/invoked/executes. For example, making an API call to the server on 
        the user’s click. If the user spam’s the click then also there will be specific 
        calls only. Like, make each call after 10 seconds.
